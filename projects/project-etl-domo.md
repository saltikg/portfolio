# ETL and Domo Visualization Project: Marketing Metrics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of an ETL pipeline to process marketing data and visualize key metrics using Domo. The goal was to automate data ingestion, transformation, and dashboard updates for seamless reporting.

## ETL Pipeline
- **Data Sources**: Data was gathered from various platforms, including Google Analytics, HubSpot, and social media accounts.
- **Data Transformation**: Python and SQL scripts were used to clean, aggregate, and transform the raw data, preparing it for visualization.
- **Data Loading**: Automated scripts loaded the cleaned data into Domo datasets daily.

## Domo Dashboard
The final dashboard provides insights into:
- **Campaign Performance**: Metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, and ROI.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Engagement across different social platforms, including trends and user behavior.
- **Sales Metrics**: Analysis of lead-to-sales conversion and customer acquisition cost.
